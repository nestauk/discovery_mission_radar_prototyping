The Secretary of State mentioned just how important it is that we have this technology if we are to decarbonise; he quoted James Richardson in making the case. It will be crucial for the abatement of heavy industries such as chemicals, glassâthe Secretary of State went to visit a glass factory in the north-west on Fridayâand cement, but it will also be crucial for hydrogen production, for the new gas-fired power stations and, indeed, for converting waste into energy.

The truth is that for hard-to-abate industriesâcement, for exampleâunless we have CCS technology, either there will be no future for these industries or they will not be able to decarbonise. Yes, it is an investment, but it is absolutely crucial, and I am struck by what the  IEA said. We are talking about probably 20% of industry, and we are doing the right thing for Britain and setting an example to the world. I always say on these occasions that, when it comes to blue hydrogen and gas with CCUS, we need all the technologies at our disposal on this decarbonisation journey. It is going to be a primarily renewables-based system, but nuclear has an important role and we need dispatchable decarbonised or low-carbon generation as well.

She is right to underline the fact that we are marking a new era but also marking the passing of an era, and it is right to pay tribute to all  the people who worked in our coal-fired power stations and, indeed, who worked underground to dig coal for our country. It is a big moment of change and the passing of an era. On the hon. Ladyâs broad points about CCS, my philosophy is that we want zero-carbon power where possible, but we also need carbon capture, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors and so that we can have not unabated gas, but gas with CCS or hydrogen power. She raises the question of cost. Imagine if we had had this conversation 15 years ago, when I was Secretary of State and much youngerâ15 years younger, to be precise. [Interruption.] Yes, I am good at maths. Some people were saying at the time, âWhy are you subsidising offshore wind? It can never be competitive with fossil fuels.â Now, it is among the cheapest technologies to build and operate. That is what deployment does for us, and that is what the combination of public and private sectors working together does for us.

Friend knows that carbon capture technologies reduce the energy intensity of fossil fuels by up to 25%, which makes such electricity much more expensive than that produced from renewables. Can the Secretary of State confirm that CCUS will be used not simply to allow the continued extraction of fossil fuel for our power sector, but only for the hardest-to-abate heavy industries and for the production of green hydrogen, thereby keeping domestic fuel bills low and delivering on this Governmentâs commitment to decarbonise our power sector by 2030 through much cheaper renewables and nuclear, not more expensive gas with CCUS?

It will be connected in 2026, but there were concerns   that connection to the grid could be delayed by 11 years. What steps will the Minister take to reduce similar delays, and does he think that the Government can meet their net zero targets if the new renewable energy infrastructure cannot be quickly connected to the grid?\n",

      "It is, and a further concern in my constituency is that the consultants who do soil sampling for the developers are often felt to be interpreting and grading the quality of soil in a way that is not consistent with local knowledge. Back in May, the previous Government allocated Â£50 million of additional support to farmers hit by the wet weather. They extended the farming recovery fund to 1,000 more farmers, so that it covered all those affected in England. On top of that, in March, we announced the allocation of an additional Â£75 million to internal drainage boards, which are essential to protecting agricultural land from floods and storms. We now have a Labour Government who neither understand nor care for rural communities. [Hon. Members: âRubbish!â] They were not so vocal when they launched their manifesto, which devoted just 87 words to farming. There was not a single mention of farming in the Kingâs Speech, because the Government have made the active choice to de-prioritise British farming and food production. On the immediate challenge, the answer to a recent parliamentary question backs up what the sector is telling me. The Â£50 million of additional farming recovery fund support is yet to be paid out. We have just established that we have had the wettest weather for 150 years and that 10 counties have had particularly challenging weather, yet despite having a known scheme, with an extra Â£50 million, they have not allocated that much-needed, time-critical support. The Secretary of State needs to explain why. The NFU says its members simply cannot wait any longer for the support, yet Labour seems to want to keep them waiting. Reports suggest that the Â£75 million for the internal drainage boards is also on a go-slow, and we need to know why. For the longer term, Labour Ministers have overruled officials to cover some of the countryâs best farmland in solar panels. They have rejected the plans for binding food security targets. It has even been suggested in media reports that they plan to cut the farming budget by Â£100 million. Indeed, it was reported that the NFU president has said that his members are being âkept up at nightâ by the âcliff edgeâ that Labourâs lack of commitment on the agriculture budget is causing. The Government need to change course. They need to give immediate confidence to the sector and show that they care about food security. To do so, they need to commit to five things: first, that the full Â£50 million of additional wet weather support we announced in May will be paid out in full.\n",

Yes, it is an investment, but it is absolutely crucial, and I am struck by what the  IEA said. We are talking about probably 20% of industry, and we are doing the right thing for Britain and setting an example to the world. I always say on these occasions that, when it comes to blue hydrogen and gas with CCUS, we need all the technologies at our disposal on this decarbonisation journey. It is going to be a primarily renewables-based system, but nuclear has an important role and we need dispatchable decarbonised or low-carbon generation as well.

She is right to underline the fact that we are marking a new era but also marking the passing of an era, and it is right to pay tribute to all  the people who worked in our coal-fired power stations and, indeed, who worked underground to dig coal for our country. It is a big moment of change and the passing of an era. On the hon. Ladyâs broad points about CCS, my philosophy is that we want zero-carbon power where possible, but we also need carbon capture, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors and so that we can have not unabated gas, but gas with CCS or hydrogen power. She raises the question of cost. Imagine if we had had this conversation 15 years ago, when I was Secretary of State and much youngerâ15 years younger, to be precise. [Interruption.] Yes, I am good at maths. Some people were saying at the time, âWhy are you subsidising offshore wind?

However, the track 1 projects include new gas power stations and new blue hydrogen, which will carry a huge greenhouse gas penalty caused by upstream methane emissions. Will the Secretary of State therefore commit to reviewing the full-lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for any project before it goes to a full investment decision?',\n",

I welcome the statement, in which he rightly underlined that anybody who ignores carbon capture, use and storage does so at their peril, and the  Governmentâs commitment to carbon capture. While the amount set aside is incredible, so too is the requirement that every penny brings an achievement. How will the Secretary of State ensure that each region of the United Kingdom is involved in this net gain? I say to him gently that Northern Ireland is not mentioned in his statement; I am sure he will address that issue. There must be accountability to ensure the realisation of environmental goals, rather than simply the aspiration of achieving them.',\n",
